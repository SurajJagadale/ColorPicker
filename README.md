# ColorPicker
A chrome Extension helps to produce a colour code of any favourite colour. It is built by using programming languages like HTML, CSS and 
javascript. In this colour picker, users can easily pick any colour on the screen, see the chosen colours, and copy or clear them with a 
single click.


HTML and CSS- I design the basic outline of the extension and mention things like picking a colour, copying it or erasing it.
Also a button for picking a colour and some colour code with colour box. By CSS, design it using two basic colours and compact in a small 
box.

Javascript - by clicking the button we generate an eyedrop, and then in  the console, we print the colour. we make an array for storing the 
colour code value by JSON stringify in the local storage. on clicking the clear-all the array gets empty. when picking the colour the code
of the colour is get a pass to the variable in HTML and the colour box to display on the screen.
